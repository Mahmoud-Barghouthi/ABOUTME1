        <!-- My Home page -->
        <p id="intro">My name is Mahmoud Barghouthi and I am 27 years old, I studied English and Spanish in The
            University of
            Jordan.</p>

        <p class="uni">
            During my university life, I have experienced many things in life. I started to work with Students' Union
            for 3 years as a video editor. Because of that I started to work with the teams of our facilities and with
            the professores. I learnt video editing from youtube and from gaming also.

        </p>

        <p class="work">
            After I graduated, I applied for an internship to teach Arabic as a second language "for non-speaker of
            arabic" for 400 Hrs, but before that I spent almost 6 months in Aqaba to work with my brother - in - law
            with his Computer shop called Smart Way. Afterwards, I began my work as a travel agent "Reservation and
            Sales officer" with Amani tours for 1 year and half.
        </p>

        <p class="hobbies">
            My favorite hobbies are gaming, basketball, football, browsing and trying everything new. One of the fun
            fact about me is when i got to any wedding or any happy occasuion, we use like Mubarak, or Kul am wa antom
            bekheer, but me, now. I did it many times "too bad bro, TOO BAD" and I say , I am sorry for your loss " عظم
            الله اجركم". EMBARRISSING, isn't it ?
